# adguard-home-settings

My recommendations for the ultimate AdGuard Home Configuration :)

*For AdGuard DNS, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-dns-settings)*.

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-home-settings), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/adguard-home-settings).

# General settings

**Block domains using filters and hosts files** -> ✅

**Filter update interval** -> `1 hour` *(You can set this to `12 hours` if it causes you any issues)*

**Use AdGuard browsing security web service** -> ❌ *(See `DNS settings` below)*

**Enable log** -> ✅ *(Having logs on is important for troubleshooting breakage)*

**Anonymize client IP** -> ✅

Query logs rotation -> **Custom** -> `1 hour `

Make sure to select **Save**.

**Enable statistics** -> ✅

Statistics retention -> **Custom** -> `1 hour`

Make sure to select **Save**.

# DNS settings

**Upstream DNS servers** ->

I would strongly recommend setting this to be [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/) for the following reasons:

* ⭐️ Based in Switzerland
* ⭐️ Non-profit
* ⭐️ Extremely effective at blocking malicious domains and threats right as they arise, moreso than AdGuard's protection above and most other DNS providers, see [here](https://divested.dev/misc/circumnavigator.txt) for a comparison.

Therefore, I would recommend setting this box to:

`https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query`

`tls://dns.quad9.net`

Make sure no other entries are present, so that Quad9's blocking is not bypassed.

<br>

**Parallel requests** -> ✅

**Fallback DNS servers** -> Leave empty

**Bootstrap DNS servers** -> Remove any entries that are already present, and set this box to the following for Quad9:

`9.9.9.9`

`149.112.112.112`

`2620:fe::fe`

`2620:fe::9`

You can now select **Test upstreams** to ensure that you configured this correctly, and then don't forget to select **Apply**.

<br>

**Rate limit** -> `0`

**Enable EDNS client subnet** -> ❌

**Enable DNSSEC** -> ✅

**Disable resolving of IPv6 addresses** -> ❌ *(Should be default, IPv6 is important)*

**Blocking mode** -> `Default` *(Other options can cause issues)*

Select **Save**.

# Encryption settings

This is out of scope for this guide, I'll probably make a separate guide dedicated just to setting this up. In the meantime, [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Encryption/)'s AdGuard's documentation on this. I would recommend configuring it if possible.

**The following settings are under `Filters`**

# DNS blocklists

Here's where it gets fun.

Despite popular opinion, due to the reasons WaLLy3K has listed [here](https://github.com/WaLLy3K/wally3k.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#why-use-this-over-other-sources), I think it's a good idea to use multiple lists and sources, rather than just limiting yourself to one or two giant lists. I myself constantly notice domains being blocked that were caught by only one or two lists and missed by others. **I'm not saying you should go overboard, but I do think it's a good idea to use a variety of high quality lists for the best coverage possible.**

I would generally recommend using the following built-in lists:

* ⭐️ `AdAway Default Blocklist` *(Appears to be included, but not checked/enabled by default or even listed on the selection screen here)*

**General**

* ⭐️ `AdGuard DNS filter` *(Enabled by default)*

* ⭐️ `AdGuard DNS Popup Hosts filter`

* ⭐️ `AWAvenue Ads Rule`

* ⭐️ `Dan Pollock's List`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Pro++ Blocklist`

* ⭐️ `OISD Blocklist Big`

* ⭐️ `Peter Lowe's Blocklist`

* ⭐️ `Steven Black's List`

If you're fine with a little breakage, I would highly recommend using `HaGeZi's `**Ultimate**` Blocklist` instead of `HaGeZi's` **Pro++**` Blocklist`.

**Other**

* ⭐️ `Dandelion Sprout's Anti Push Notifications`

* ⭐️ `Dandelion Sprout's Game Console Adblock List`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Allowlist Referral` *(See `Custom filtering rules` section below)*

* ⭐️ `Perflyst and Dandelion Sprout's Smart-TV Blocklist`

* ⭐️ `WindowsSpyBlocker - Hosts spy rules`

**Security**

* ⭐️ `Phishing URL Blocklist (PhishTank and OpenPhish)`

* ⭐️ `Dandelion Sprout's Anti-Malware List`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Badware Hoster Blocklist`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's DynDNS Blocklist`

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's The World's Most Abused TLDs` *(Causes rare breakage but heavily improves security, I've seen this work in real-time, blocking scam/spam domains before they were picked up by any lists)*

* ⭐️ `HaGeZi's Threat Intelligence Feeds`

* ⭐️ `NoCoin Filter List`

* ⭐️ `Phishing Army`

* ⭐️ `Scam Blocklist by DurableNapkin`

* ⭐️ `ShadowWhisperer's Malware List`

* ⭐️ `Stalkerware Indicators List`

* ⭐️ `The Big List of Hacked Malware Web Sites`

* ⭐️ `uBlock filters - Badware risks`

* ⭐️ `Malicious URL Blocklist (URLHaus)`

**Custom lists**

I would additionally recommend adding the following lists:

* ⭐️ Ut1 Phishing Domains: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olbat/ut1-blacklists/master/blacklists/phishing/domains`

* ⭐️ WaLLy3K's Personal Blocklist: `https://v.firebog.net/hosts/static/w3kbl.txt`

Additionally, if you're fine with a little breakage, I would highly recommend:

* 1Hosts (Pro): `https://o0.pages.dev/Pro/adblock.txt`

* My BadBlock **+** instead of BadBlock: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/badblock_plus.txt`

* HaGeZi's Encrypted DNS Servers - IPs: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/doh-ips.txt`

It might seem like a lot, but these are carefully picked high quality lists with strong coverage, and it doesn't really hurt to use multiple like this.

You could also consider, depending on your preference:

* DeveloperDan's AMP Blocklist: `https://www.github.developerdan.com/hosts/lists/amp-hosts-extended.txt` - Blocks [AMP](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/18-de-amp/#why-is-amp-harmful) websites

* BadBlock - DRM: `https://codeberg.org/celenity/BadBlock/raw/branch/main/abp/drm.txt` - Blocks websites associated with [DRM](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/drms-dead-canary-how-we-just-lost-web-what-we-learned-it-and-what-we-need-do-next) technology/its provisioning 

# DNS allowlists

I would recommending adding the following here:

* ⭐️ BadBlock Whitelist: `https://badblock.celenity.dev/abp/whitelist.txt`

* ⭐️ HaGeZi's URL Shorteners: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/adblock/whitelist-urlshortener.txt`

# Blocked services

You should use this feature to your advantage and block any services that you don't use or care about. This can dramatically improve your privacy by preventing connections to them from even being made. If you use a service, don't block it, just block what you're comfortable with and works best for you.

I usually block the following:

* **Facebook**

* **Instagram** *(Facebook)*

* **LinkedIn**

* **QQ**

* **Rakuten Viki**

* **Snapchat**

* **Spotify**

* **TikTok**

* **Viber** *(Rakuten)*

* **VK.com**

* **WeChat**

* **WhatsApp** *(Facebook)*

Then select **Apply**.

# Custom filtering rules 

While being nice from a usability perspective, HaGeZi's Referral Allowlist and the AdGuard DNS filter list do allow some questionable ad/tracking domains we don't want unblocked. I would recommend adding the following to your filtering rules:

`||adservice.google.*^$important`

`||adsterra.com^$important`

`||amplitude.com^$important`

`||analytics.edgekey.net^$important`

`||analytics.twitter.com^$important`

`||app.adjust.*^$important`

`||app.*.adjust.com^$important`

`||app.appsflyer.com^$important`

`||doubleclick.net^$important`

`||googleadservices.com^$important`

`||guce.advertising.com^$important`

`||metric.gstatic.com^$important`

`||mmstat.com^$important`

`||statcounter.com^$important`

Now select **Apply**.

# Additional recommendations

* Use a privacy-respecting browser like [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with my [Phoenix](https://phoenix.celenity.dev).

* Use a content blocking extension like [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). *(See recommended settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/ublock-origin-settings))*

* Enable Safe Browsing in your browser if possible and if it's not done in a privacy-invasive way. (You should use i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Standard" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Firefox's Safe Browsing](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work), [Brave's Safe Browsing](https://brave.com/privacy/browser/#safe-browsing), & [Safari's Fraudulent Website Warning](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari/), you should avoid most other options i.e. [Google Safe Browsing on "Enhanced" Mode](https://safebrowsing.google.com/), [Microsoft SmartScreen](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/), & [Opera Sitecheck](https://blogs.opera.com/security/2021/01/making-browsing-safe-from-phishing/)).

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible. On Windows, you can use the built-in [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender_Antivirus), on macOS, you can stick to the built-in [XProtect](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web), on Android, you can use [Hypatia](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/), and on Linux, you can use [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/). **NOTE:** You should install Hypatia through the [DivestOS Official Repo](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467) instead of F-Droid's main repo, as it will allow you to receive quicker updates directly from the developer. It's also recommended to use [F-Droid Basic](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.basic/) as your F-Droid client of choice.
